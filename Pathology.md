# Pathology
## Cellular Pathology
### Growth Adaptation
- Stress increases/decreases → organ size increases/decreases
- Permanent tissues only undergo hypertrophy
  1. Cardiac myocytes
  2. Skeletal muscles
  3. Nerves
#### Hyperplasia
- Via the increase in the **number** of cells
- Involving the production of new cells from stem cells
- Pathologic hyperplasia can progress to dysplasia and cancer
  1. Endometrial hyperplasia → endometrial carcinoma
  2. Benign prostatic hyperplasia
#### Hypertrophy
- Via the increase in the **size** of cells
- Involving gene activation, protein synthesis, and production of organelles
#### Atrophy
- Via the decrease in the size and number of cells
- Decrease in cell number: 
  1. Occurs via [[apoptosis]]
- Decrease in cell size: 
  1. **Ubiquitin-proteosome degradation** of the [[cytoskeleton]]
  2. [[Autophagy]] of cellular components
#### Metaplasia
- Changes in **stress** → changes in **cell type**
- Mostly involving the surface epithelium
- Metaplastic cells are better able to handle new stress
- Occurs via **reprogramming** of stem cells
- **Reversible** with the removal of the driving stressor
- Metaplasia can progress to dysplasia and cancer
- [[Vitamin A]] deficiency can result in metaplasia (keratomalacia)

- Mesenchymal tissues can undergo metaplasia (myositis ossificans)

1. Barrett's esophagus (epithelium in esophagus: squamous → columnar)
2. Apocrine metaplasia ↛ breast cancer
#### Dysplasia
- Disordered cellular growth
- Refers to the proliferation of precancerous cells (CIN)
- Arises from longstanding pathologic hyperplasia or metaplasia
- **Reversible** with alleviation of inciting stress
- If stress persists, dysplasia progresses to **carcinoma**
#### Aplasia
- Failure of cell production during embryogenesis
1. Unilateral renal agenesis
#### Hypoplasia
- Decrease in cell production during embryogenesis
- Results in a relatively small organ
1. Streak ovary in Turner syndrome
