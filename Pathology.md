# Pathology
## Cellular Pathology
### Growth Adaptation
- Stress increases/decreases â†’ organ size increases/decreases
- Permanent tissues only undergo hypertrophy
  1. Cardiac myocytes
  2. Skeletal muscles
  3. Nerves

| Adaptation      |     |
| --------------- | --- |
| [[Hypertrophy]] |     |
| [[Hyperplasia]] |     |
| [[Atrophy]]     |     |
| [[Metaplasia]]  |     |
| [[Dysplasia]]   |     |
| [[Aplasia]]                |     |



#### Hypoplasia
- Decrease in cell production during embryogenesis
- Results in a relatively small organ
1. Streak ovary in Turner syndrome
### Cellular Injury
- Occurs when stress exceeds the cell's ability to adapt
- Depends on the type of stress, severity, and type of cell adapted
