# Pathology
## Cellular Pathology
### Growth Adaptation
- Stress increases/decreases → organ size increases/decreases
- Permanent tissues only undergo hypertrophy
  1. Cardiac myocytes
  2. Skeletal muscles
  3. Nerves
#### Hyperplasia
- Via the increase in the **number** of cells
- Involving the production of new cells from stem cells
- Pathologic hyperplasia can progress to dysplasia and cancer
  1. Endometrial hyperplasia → endometrial carcinoma
  2. Benign prostatic hyperplasia
#### Hypertrophy
- Via the increase in the **size** of cells
- Involving gene activation, protein synthesis, and production of organelles
#### Atrophy
- Via the decrease in the size and number of cells
- Decrease in cell number: 
  1. Occurs via [[apoptosis]]
- Decrease in cell size: 
  1. **Ubiquitin-proteosome degradation** of the [[cytoskeleton]]
  2. [[Autophagy]] of cellular components
#### Metaplasia
- Changes in **stress** → changes in **cell type**
- Mostly involving the surface epithelium
- Metaplastic cells are better able to handle new stress
- Occurs via reprogramming of stem cells
- Reversible with 
1. Barrett's esophagus (epithelium in esophagus: squamous → columnar)
