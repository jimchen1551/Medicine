# Pathology
## Cell
### Growth Adaptation
- Stress increases/decreases â†’ organ size increases/decreases
- Permanent tissues only undergo hypertrophy
  1. Cardiac myocytes
  2. Skeletal muscles
  3. Nerves

| Adaptation      |
| --------------- |
| [[Hypertrophy]] |
| [[Hyperplasia]] |
| [[Atrophy]]     |
| [[Aplasia]]     |
| [[Hypoplasia]]  |
| [[Metaplasia]]  |
| [[Dysplasia]]   |

### Cellular Injury
- Occurs when stress exceeds the cell's ability to adapt
- Depends on the type of stress, severity, and type of cell adapted

| Cause                            |
| -------------------------------- |
| [[Inflammation]]                 |
| Nutritional excess or deficiency |
| [[Hypoxia]]                      |
| Trauma                           |
| Genetic mutation                 |

### Cell Death
- Morphologic hallmark is the **loss of the [[nucleus]]**
- Occurs via pyknosis, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis

| Mechanism     |
| ------------- |
| [[Necrosis]]  |
| [[Apoptosis]] |
