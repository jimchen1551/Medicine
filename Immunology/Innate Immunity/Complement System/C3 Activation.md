# C3 Activation
![[Pasted image 20230901111109.png]]
- C3 convertase (**C4b2a** here) cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b
- C3 contains a strained **thioester** bond
	- Because the thioester bond is so strained and stressed, as it is exposed sometimes C3 spontaneously breaks into C3a and C3b. 
	- The exposed thioester bond is a good **nucleophile** (partial or charged negative), so it may react with 
	  1. **H2O** and generate soluble and inactive C3b
	  2. **R-OH** or **R-NH2** and generate active C3b on the pathogen surfaces
- C3a activates [[Inflammation]]
- C3b activates [[Opsonization]] and [[Membrane Attack Complex]]
