- activated by factors B and D and active C3b (no matter it's active or inactive) produced by other pathways
- **Factor B** spontaneously binds to **C3(H2O)** and is cleaved by **factor D** to form **C3(H2O)Bb**, which is a **C3 convertase**. (amplification of complement fixation)
- **C3b** then binds with **factor B** and the complex is cleaved by **factor D** to form **C3bBb**, which is also a **C3 convertase**. (amplification of complement fixation)
- For pathogens lacking complement-regulatory proteins ([[Complement Regulation]]), **Properdin** (**factor P**) binds with C3bBb to stabilize the complex acting like a C3 convertase
