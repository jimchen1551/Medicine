- activated by factors B and D and active C3b (no matter it's active or inactive) produced by other pathways
- **Factor B** binds to **C3(H2O)** and is cleaved by **factor D** spontaneously. 
- C3(H2O)Bb then cleave the 
- After C3bBb is generated, it performs like a C3 convertase and cleaves more and more C3 (amplification of complement fixation occurred)
- For pathogens lacking complement-regulatory proteins ([[Complement Regulation]]), Properdin (factor P) binds with C3bBb to stabilize the complex acting like a C3 convertase
