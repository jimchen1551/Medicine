- Initiated by antibody binding to a pathogen surface
- After antibodies binding, **C1** binds antibodies on pathogen surfaces
- **C2** and **C4** will be cleaved and form the classical **C3 convertase** (**C4b2a**) stuck on the pathogen surfaces
- C3 convertase cleaves C3 and makes C3b stuck on the pathogen surface
