- [[Phagocytosis]] is performed by resident [[Neutrophil]]s and [[Macrophage]]s
- These cells have PRRs to conduct self/non-self recognition
- These receptors can recognize the following types of patterns:
  1. Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP)
  2. Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP)
- After phagocytosis, the phagosome combines with lysosomes to form phagolysosome
- [[Macrophage]]s then secrete inflammatory cytokines
## Cytokines
[[Inflammation]]
