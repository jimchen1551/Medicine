- [[Phagocytosis]] is performed by resident [[Neutrophil]]s and [[Macrophage]]s which have [[Phagocytosis#Pattern Recognition Receptor]] to recognize self/non-self entities. 
- After phagocytosis, the phagosome combines with lysosomes to form phagolysosome. 
- [[Macrophage]]s then secrete inflammatory cytokines
## Cell-derived mediators
- [[TNF-Î±]], [[IL-6]], CXCL8, CCL2, [[IL-12]]
