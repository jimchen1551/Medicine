# Mast Cell
- Granules inside stained (H&E) blue in the basic environment

1. Activated by **trauma** → Degranulation
2. Activated by **[[IgE]] aggregation** → Degranulation
3. Activated by **C3a**
4. Activated by **C5a**
5. Activated by **vancomycin** directly → Degranulation
   → Red man syndrome: widespread red rash
6. Releasing **histamine**
   → making blood vessels more leaky
   → dilating the blood vessels to increase local blood flow
7. Releasing **heparin**
   → mediating the synthesis of bradykinin and other inflammatory cytokines to increase blood flow
   → maintaining blood flow in capillaries due to its anti-coagulation
8. Releasing **eosinophil chemotactic factors**
   → attracting [[eosinophil]]s
9. Releasing **tryptase**
   - a good in-serum indicator of mast cell activation
10. Contributing to **allergic reactions**/**anaphylaxis**
    → **Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction**
11. Contributing to **asthma**
12. Stabilized by drugs **Cromolyn** and **Nedocromil**
