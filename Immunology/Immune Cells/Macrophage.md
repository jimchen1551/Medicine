- In the blood, called [[monocyte]]
- In the bone, called [[osteoclast]]
- In the brain, called [[microglia]]
- In the liver, called [[Kupffer cell]]

- Kidney-shaped [[nucleus]]
- Frosted glass [[cytoplasm]]
- Antigen-presenting cell APC

1. Activated by **[[IFN γ]]** ← [[Th1 cell]]
2. **[[Phagocytosis]]**
3. **Antigen presentation**: [[MHC II]]
4. Releasing **[[IL-12]]** → [[Th1 cell]]
5. Releasing **[[IL-1]]** → [[Inflammation]]
6. Releasing **[[TNF-α]]** → [[Inflammation]]
7. Releasing **VEGF** and **[[TGF β]]**
    → Cell proliferation and Tissue regeneration
    → Wound repair 
8. Releasing **Elastase**
   → Cleaving elastins
   → Breaking down dead or infected tissues
   → Helping with tissue remodeling and healing
9. Releasing **Metalloproteases**
   → Cleaving proteins in the extracellular matrix
10. Expressing **CD14**
    → Activation of macrophages
    - a surface receptor for lipopolysaccharides LPS
    - Gram-negative bacteria → systemic macrophage activation → sepsis

## Granuloma formation

- Sometimes, the pathogen is really stubborn and hard to eliminate.  
- The immune system decides to wall off the pathogen and keep it from spreading. 
- A granuloma is a lesion surrounded by a collar of lymphocytes. 
- The core of granuloma contains active macrophages.
