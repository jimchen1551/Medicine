# Neutrophil
![[Screenshot 2023-09-22 at 09.45.53.png]]
- 3-5 lobed [[nucleus]]
- The most abundant polymorphonuclear cell **PMN**
- The first cell engaged in [[Inflammation]] ⇒ increase in neutrophil number

## Attracted by
1. **C5a** after [[C5 Activation]]
2. **Leukotriene B4** LTB4
3. **[[IL-8]]**

## [[Phagocytosis]]
- The main phagocytic killer in the innate immune system
- Arriving on the site of infection or [[Inflammation]]

## Neutrophil Extracellular Traps
- *abbr.* NETs
- Fibers that capture pathogens
- Made while neutrophil is overwhelmed by infection

## Granule

1. Myeloperoxidase **MPO**
   - blue-green compound
   - catalyzing oxidative burst and bleach (very toxic to microbes)
   - target of p-ANCA (anti-MPO antibody)
2. **Elastase**
   - cutting elastin (elastic fiber in the extracellular matrix in tissues)
   - breaking down dead or injured stuff during wound healing and tissue remodeling
   - excess of elastase activity in the lung causes [[Emphysema]], 
     e.g., alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency
3. **Lysozyme**
   - killing bacteria by hydrolyzing the peptidoglycan walls in a hole
   - located inside the secondary granules
4. **NADPH Oxidase**
   - involving neutrophil oxidative burst

## Degranulation
- Releasing all the stuff in neutrophil granules
- Including many active antimicrobial toxins

## Demargination
- Not related to [[inflammation]]
- Caused by [[corticosteroid]]s
- Increase in circulating neutrophils following steroids used
- Margination: Most resting neutrophils are attached to the walls of blood vessels in the liver, spleen, and lungs. 

## Oxidative Burst
$$\text{O}_2\xrightarrow[\text{oxidase}]{\text{NADPH}}\text{O}_2^-\xrightarrow[]{SOD}\text{H}_2\text{O}_2$$
$$\text{H}_2\text{O}_2\xrightarrow[]{MPO}\text{HClO}^-$$
$$\text{H}_2\text{O}_2\xrightarrow[]{Catalase}\text{H}_2\text{O}+\text{O}_2$$

- Generating reactive oxidative species toxic to the pathogen
1. First catalyzed by **NADPH oxidase**
  - transferring an electron from NADPH to an oxygen molecule
  - creating a superoxide
  - defect of this enzyme leads to immunodeficiency
    e.g., [[Chronic granulomatous disease]] **CGD**
2. **Superoxide**
   - the first reactive compound
   - anti-microbial activity
3. Superoxide Dismutase **SOD**
4. **Hydrogen Peroxide**
   - produced by SOD
   - toxic to microbes
   - killing pathogens ingested by phagocytosis
5. **Catalase**
   - degrading hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen
   - expressed by some bacteria → bacteria survived from oxidative burst
   - In [[chronic granulomatous disease]], the reactive oxygen species level is already low, and catalase further eliminates the hydrogen peroxide from this equation. 
     ⇒ infected by catalase+ organisms
6. Myeloperoxidase **MPO**
   - catalyzing the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into hypochlorous acid/bleach
7. Hypochlorous acid/**Bleach**
   - used to ultimately kill the phagocytose microbes
