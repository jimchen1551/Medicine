# Neutrophil
- 3-5 lobed nuclei
- The most abundant polymorphonuclear cell (PMN)
- The first cell engaged in [[Inflammation]] â‡’ increase in neutrophil number

## Attracted by
1. C5a after [[C5 Activation]]
2. Leukotriene B4
3. IL-8

## [[Phagocytosis]]
- The main phagocytic killer in the innate immune system
- Arriving on the site of infection or [[Inflammation]]

## Neutrophil Extracellular Traps
- *abbr.* NETs
- Fibers that capture pathogens
- Made while neutrophil is overwhelmed by infection

## Granule
1. Myeloperoxidase (MPO)
   - blue-green compound
   - catalyzing oxidative burst and bleach (very toxic to microbes)
   - target of p-ANCA (anti-MPO antibody)
2. Elastase
   - 

## Degranulation
- Releasing all the stuff in neutrophil granules
- Including many active antimicrobial toxins

## Demargination
- Not related to [[inflammation]]
- Caused by [[corticosteroid]]s
- Increase in circulating neutrophils following steroids used
- Margination: Most resting neutrophils are attached to the walls of blood vessels in the liver, spleen, and lungs.
