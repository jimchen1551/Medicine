# Neutrophil
- 3-5 lobed nuclei
- The most abundant polymorphonuclear cell PMN
- The first cell engaged in [[Inflammation]] ⇒ increase in neutrophil number

## Attracted by
1. C5a after [[C5 Activation]]
2. Leukotriene B4
3. IL-8

## [[Phagocytosis]]
- The main phagocytic killer in the innate immune system
- Arriving on the site of infection or [[Inflammation]]

## Neutrophil Extracellular Traps
- *abbr.* NETs
- Fibers that capture pathogens
- Made while neutrophil is overwhelmed by infection

## Granule
1. Myeloperoxidase MPO
   - blue-green compound
   - catalyzing oxidative burst and bleach (very toxic to microbes)
   - target of p-ANCA (anti-MPO antibody)
2. Elastase
   - cutting elastin (elastic fiber in the extracellular matrix in tissues)
   - breaking down dead or injured stuff during wound healing and tissue remodeling
   - excess of elastase activity in the lung causes [[Emphysema]], 
     e.g., alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency
3. Lysozyme
   - killing bacteria by hydrolyzing the peptidoglycan walls in a hole
   - located inside the secondary granules
4. NADPH Oxidase
   - involving neutrophil oxidative burst

## Degranulation
- Releasing all the stuff in neutrophil granules
- Including many active antimicrobial toxins

## Demargination
- Not related to [[inflammation]]
- Caused by [[corticosteroid]]s
- Increase in circulating neutrophils following steroids used
- Margination: Most resting neutrophils are attached to the walls of blood vessels in the liver, spleen, and lungs. 

## Oxidative Burst
- Generating reactive oxidative species toxic to the pathogen
1. First catalyzed by NADPH oxidase
  - transferring an electron from NADPH to an oxygen molecule
  - creating a superoxide
  - defect of this enzyme leads to immunodeficiency
    e.g., [[Chronic granulomatous disease]] CGD
2. Superoxide
   - the first reactive compound
   - anti-microbial activity
3. Superoxide Dismutase SOD
4. Hydrogen Peroxide
   - produced by SOD
   - toxic to microbes
   - killing pathogens ingested by phagocytosis
5. Catalase
   - degrading hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen
   - expressed by some bacteria → bacteria survived from oxidative burst
   - In [[chronic granulomatous disease]], the reactive oxygen species level is already low, and catalase further eliminates the hydrogen peroxide from this equation. 
     ⇒ infected by catalase+ organisms
6. Myeloperoxidase MPO
   - catalyzing the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into hypochlorous acid/bleach
7. Hypochlorous acid/Bleach
   - used to ultimately kill the phagocytose microbes
