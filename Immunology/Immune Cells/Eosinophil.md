# Eosinophil
- 2 lobed (bilobate) [[nucleus]]
- Granules inside stained pink in the acidic environment
- Involved in allergic/anaphylactic (hives) reactions
   → causing **asthma**: major basic protein is very toxic to epithelial cells

1. Recruited and stimulated by **[[IL-5]]**
2. Activated by [[IgG]] or [[IgE]] Fc → Fc receptor → Degranulation
3. Releasing **Major Basic Protein** MBP fighting helminths/worms

- Inhibited by [[corticosteroid]]s
- Abnormal eosinophils cause vasculitis
  e.g., [[Churg-Strauss Syndrome]] (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis **EPGA**): eosinophils are activated at blood vessels and degranulate major basic proteins to pose damage to endothelial cells
