# Eosinophil
- 2 lobed (bilobate) [[nucleus]]
- Granules inside acidly stained pink
- Involved in allergic/anaphylactic (hives) reactions
1. Recruited and stimulated by IL-5
2. Activated by [[IgG]] or [[IgE]] Fc → Fc receptor → Degranulation
3. Releasing Major Basic Protein MBP fighting helminths/worms

- Abnormal eosinophils cause vasculitis; e.g., [[Churg-Strauss Syndrome]] (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis EPGA): eosinophils are activated at blood vessels and degranulate major basic proteins pose to endothelial cells
