# Basophil
- Granules inside stained blue in the basic environment

1. Activated by [[IgE]] Fc → Fc receptor → Degranulation
2. Releasing **histamine** → [[Inflammation]] (increasing the permeability in blood vessels) or [[Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction]]
3. Releasing **heparin** → anti-coagulation
4. Releasing **leukotriene** (pro-inflammatory mediator)
5. **[[Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction]]** (allergy and hive)

- In [[chronic myeloid leukemia]] **CML**, basophil count elevates (basophilia).
