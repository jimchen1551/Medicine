# IgM
- Usually in the pentameric form (connected via a J chain)
- Archetypal (original) immunoglobulin produced by [[B Cell]]s
- Immediate response to antigen
- Cannot cross the placenta

1. Undergoing class switching to form other types of [[antibody]]
2. Making up membrane-bound [[B Cell]] receptors
  - During [[B cell]] activation, it binds to the antigen
3. [[Complement System#Complement Fixation]]
   - attracting C1 binds to it and triggering [[Classical Pathway]]
   - [[IgM]] does better than it
