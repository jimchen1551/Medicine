# Primary Active Transport
- Has carrier
- ATP required
- Moves against gradient
## Examples
1. Na+, K+-ATPase (Na+-K+ pump) in [[cell membrane]]s
   - 3Na+ efflux, 2K+ influx
   - Specific inhibitors: cardiac glycoside drugs [[Ouabain]] and [[Digitalis]]
2. Ca2+-ATPase (Ca2+ pump) in the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] (called SERCA), [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (called SERCA) and [[cell membrane]]
3. H+, K+-ATPase (proton pump) in gastric parietal cells and renal $\alpha$-intercalated cells
   - Specific inhibitors: [[Omeprazole]]
