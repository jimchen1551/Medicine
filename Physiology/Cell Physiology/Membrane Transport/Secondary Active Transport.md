# Secondary Active Transport
- transport of solutes is coupled
- one of the solutes is transported downhill as the energy supplier
## Examples
1. Na+-glucose cotransport in the luminal membrane of intestinal mucosal and renal proximal tubule cells
2. Na+-Ca2+ countertransport in [[Cell Membrane]]s
   - the Na+ gradient is maintained by Na+-K+ pump
     â‡’ poisoning Na+-K+ pump inhibits Na+-Ca2+ countertransport
