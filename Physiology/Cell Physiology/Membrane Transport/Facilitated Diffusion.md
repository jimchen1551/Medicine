# Facilitated Diffusion
- Facilitated by carrier
- No energy required
- Follows gradient
- Rapid than [[Simple Diffusion]]
## Examples
1. GLUT4 in muscle and adipose cells transports glucose. 
   - [[Diabetes Mellitus]]: The carriers require [[Insulin]]
2. UT1 in inner medullary collecting ducts transports urea for absorption. 
   - UT1 is upregulated by [[Antidiuretic Hormone]] (ADH)
