# Hypoxia

| Cause                 |
| --------------------- |
| [[Ischemia]]          |
| [[Hypoxemia]]         |
| [[Anemia]]            |
| [[CO Poisoning]]      |
| [[Methemoglobinemia]] |

- Low oxygen delivery to tissue
- Impairs oxidative phosphorylation
- Results in decreased ATP â†’ disrupts key cellular functions
  1. Na+-K+ pump ([[Primary Active Transport]])
  2. Ca2+ pump ([[Primary Active Transport]])
  3. Aerobic [[Glycolysis]]

- Initial phase is reversible
  - Hallmark is cellular swelling
  - Leads to loss of microvilli, membrane blebbing, and swelling of [[Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum|RER]]
