# Metaplasia
- Changes in **stress** → changes in **cell type**
- Mostly involving the surface epithelium
- Metaplastic cells are better able to handle new stress
- Occurs via **reprogramming** of stem cells
- **Reversible** with the removal of the driving stressor
- Metaplasia can progress to [[dysplasia]] and cancer
- [[Vitamin A]] deficiency can result in metaplasia (keratomalacia)
